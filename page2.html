 <h1> My Point of View
 <h1/>
  <p> My Point of View:
  I believe that if you know the risks you are taking and you know what the consequences can be I think it's okay for you to download movies illegaly. I've never downloaded movies but I have illegaly watched them off a website and I haven't gotten a virus or in trouble with anyone yet, knock on wood.
